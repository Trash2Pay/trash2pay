# Trash2Pay ♻️

Trash2Pay is a decentralized waste management platform that connects households, businesses, and waste collectors through **verifiable waste pickup records** and **instant micro-payments** powered by Bitcoin SV (BSV).

The platform incentivizes responsible waste disposal using **T2P Units**, a non-speculative utility unit earned through verified waste collection activities.
